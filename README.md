## Problem Statement 
What's in a brand?

A company's branding shapes how people perceive, trust, and connect with a company. It differentiates a company from its competitors, contributes to building customer loyalty, and drives purchase decisions with recongnition and trust. One of the ways companies build their brand image is through ads, and the fashion industry, with its crowded landscape, typically has companies running ads in many marketing channels. 

In this project, we will explore fashion ads on Meta platforms, one of the most popular channel for digital marketing. While the ads posted might not be designated for brand marketing, it's interesting to explore how a company portrays itself hollistically, as well as to each customer segment. 

Some questions of interest are the following: 
- What elements of ads does a company use to portray its brand?
- Do these companies have distinctive styles that differentiate its ads from its competitors?  
- How does a company adjust their messaging and visuals for different demographics?
